                Small-scale hydroelectricity projects can help communities
                become more energy resilient. With high costs and specialised
                engineering involved, they haven’t always been the go-to
                renewable energy source, but that could be about to change

                  The pounding thunder of a waterfall, the pull of a river’s
                  current, the swell of an ocean wave. They all represent raw
                  energy in one of its most natural forms – and harnessing it is
                  nothing new. The ancient Greeks used water power to grind
                  wheat into flour. And it was water – not steam – that drove
                  blast furnaces and cotton-spinning machinery at the dawn of
                  the Industrial Revolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the late 1800s the world’s first hydroelectric generator
                  was powering a single lightbulb in a Northumberland mansion
                  house, and within a few years this nascent technology had
                  rippled across the globe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Small-scale hydro may have fallen out of favour as the
                  national grid turned the UK on to the notion of cheap and
                  convenient electricity at the flick of a switch, but now –
                  with the twin spectres of climate change and a deepening
                  energy crisis – the stage could be set for a revival.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “People are looking at energy very differently right now,”
                  says Kate Gilmartin, the new CEO of the British Hydropower
                  Association. “Energy security is at the top of the agenda and
                  we’ve realised that our country is awash with natural energy
                  resources, yet still reliant on a volatile global fossil fuel
                  market.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The UK is home to some 1,560 hydropower schemes, but they meet
                  less than 2 per cent of our electricity needs, and hydro has
                  long played second fiddle to solar and wind.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “It’s always been the Cinderella at the ball because of the
                  high capital cost,” says Gilmartin, explaining how hydro
                  demands bespoke, location-specific engineering, a far cry from
                  comparatively cheap solar panels. “It’s never been seen for
                  the value it gives in keeping the lights on through windless,
                  dark nights in winter – and that’s going to become more and
                  more of a problem.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The government’s feed-in tariff, which pays clean energy
                  schemes for the power they generate, gave costly hydro
                  projects a financial leg up, but the door to new applicants
                  closed in 2019.

                  “Now energy prices have increased, suddenly loads of hydro
                  schemes that were mothballed because they couldn’t make the
                  business case stack up are being reconsidered,” says
                  Gilmartin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Besides new builds, hundreds of historic water mills are ripe
                  for conversion to hydro. Standing in the way are significant
                  hurdles, not least the Environment Agency’s (EA) hike in fees
                  for permits. Depending on the size of the scheme, fees are up
                  almost 800 per cent, from £1,500 to more than £13,000, an
                  increase the EA says is justified by increasing pressures on
                  water resources and the need to invest in a more sustainable
                  approach to their use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, angling lobbies and conservationists argue that
                  hydro schemes impact delicate ecosystems and impede fish
                  migration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Anything industrial in a natural environment is seen as
                  alien,” Gilmartin says. “But archimedes screw turbines’ are
                  fish friendly, and hydro projects usually include a fish
                  ladder, so you’re actually improving upstream migration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “These schemes bring people to the river environment, it’s an
                  opportunity to talk to them about flooding and flood
                  mitigation. Putting a hydro in means thinking about the whole
                  river catchment.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another barrier is the National Grid’s ageing infrastructure.
                  As we transition from fossil fuels, demand for electricity is
                  rising. But with grid capacity stretched to the limit,
                  Gilmartin says there’s little wiggle room for additional power
                  generation.

                <p>
                  “People will start moving to electric vehicles and heat pumps,
                  but there’s no capacity until the grid gets reinforced,” she
                  says. “That’s a big factor across lots of renewable energy
                  projects – their generation is curtailed, basically cut off
                  because the grid can’t cope.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The answer, Gilmartin believes, lies in generating and
                  consuming energy locally. If the local turbine has some power
                  to spare, why not throw it at a few homes or domestic hot
                  water tanks?
                </p>
                <p>
                  “We need to be much cleverer about how we consume energy, by
                  balancing everything more locally,” Gilmartin says.
                  “Electricity is the lifeblood of society. We have to look
                  really hard to tap into all the natural resources on our
                  rainy, windy, tidal island nation.”

                    Food prices might be rising, but Aldi shoppers have found
                    something to smile about after a black cat began frequenting
                    one store. Lupin's owners said he liked to "wander" and was
                    a regular visitor to the branch in Haverhill, Suffolk.

                  Doom has become a profitable industry. Do a quick search for
                  ‘wipe out humans’ and Google will spit out page after page of
                  the-end-is-nigh predictions: ‘Researchers warn artificial
                  intelligence could one day kill everyone’; ‘Study says zombies
                  would wipe out humans in less than 100 days’.

                <p>
                  It’s all great Hollywood fodder. Clickable content. But, as
                  the scientist and writer John Hands argues in his latest book
                  The Future of Humankind, when these types of forecasts are
                  tested against their eventual outcomes, they are always
                  disproven – often wildly so.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following on from the success of this last book, Cosmosapiens,
                  which was named one of 2015’s best science books by the
                  Telegraph, the former University of North London lecturer, has
                  spent the last six years delving into the evidence surrounding
                  the main existential threats to humankind, and offers a
                  different take: we should be more optimistic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I felt that the current general climate was pessimistic,”
                  Hands tells Positive News. To test that theory he took a
                  critical look at the chances of the human race being snuffed
                  out by national disasters, warfare, biological accidents,
                  population increases, AI, and climate change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He suggests that most existential threats had a low or
                  negligible probability of coming true, and that there were
                  many reasons to be sanguine. “My approach was to examine, as
                  objectively as possible, long-term patterns,” says Hands. “I
                  tried to avoid what’s happening in the day-to-day.”

                  Hands theorises that Homo sapiens are distinguished from other
                  species by a “reflective consciousness”; the ability to think
                  about ourselves and our future, and act in our own interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For millennia, humans have moved freely around the world,
                  sharing ideas. Scientific progress has been achieved through
                  our findings. Humans have created a collective consciousness,
                  he argues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, Hands is one of an emerging set of writers offering a
                  more positive outlook on our future, including Dutch historian
                  Rutger Bregman who believes that humans are cooperative and
                  kind by nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Throughout history, a cynical view of human nature has always
                  been a legitimisation of power,” Bregman told Positive News.
                  “A hopeful view of human nature leads to institutions with
                  more freedom. Because if people can’t trust each other, then
                  they need powerful people to look over them. But if we can
                  trust each other, we can live in a much more egalitarian,
                  genuinely democratic society.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hands believes that altruism, creativity and a convergence of
                  ideas have helped to foster human cooperation. He argues that
                  this has allowed us to evolve from being in tribes, to being
                  part of agricultural villages, and to creating global
                  organisations like the United Nations. What’s more, Hands
                  suggests this collective consciousness is “an accelerating
                  progression”. Our long-term outlook, he argues, is good; it’s
                  ours to determine.

                  “We are currently in the process of collectively deciding to
                  restrict technological developments that result in increasing
                  greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere,” Hands writes on climate
                  change, though he admits progress is “often two steps forward,
                  one step back.”
                </p>
                <p>So is the doom unfounded?</p>
                <p>
                  Hands found that most existential threats had a low or
                  negligible probability of coming true, such as being wiped out
                  by an asteroid like dinosaurs. “The balance of evidence
                  strongly suggests that an asteroid impact was not the main
                  cause of a mass species extinction 66m years ago,” he writes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whilst a large asteroid certainly did hit present-day Mexico
                  around this time, the fossil evidence suggests a much more
                  gradual extinction rather than a full-on wipeout. The timespan
                  was sufficiently long enough for some dinosaurs to evolve into
                  birds. Reassuringly, Nasa says there are no comparably large
                  asteroids in orbits that could potentially hit Earth.

                  Fears of nuclear war have, understandably, ramped up since
                  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and Vladimir Putin’s subsequent
                  decision to suspend the New START nuclear treaty (which he did
                  the same week Hands’ book came out).
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s impossible to predict the implications of recent events,
                  but Hands suggests that we should take comfort from the fact
                  that the global nuclear weapons stockpile has shrunk to around
                  one fifth of its 1990 peak. This has been achieved through
                  international agreements, and declarations between nuclear
                  states – including Russia, China and the US – that a nuclear
                  war cannot be won and should not be fought.
                </p>

                  This ability for humans to reflect on the threats we face and
                  create solutions is the book’s overarching theme. From
                  vaccines and laser systems that deflect comets, to a reduction
                  in conflict mortality, the human race has long made progress
                  in extending its own survival. More of us are living longer
                  than ever before. Now we are turning our attention to the
                  survival of other species (albeit not urgently enough), with
                  last week’s global agreement to protect oceans reminding us
                  that positive change is possible.

                  Another perceived threat gaining international attention
                  recently is AI. Stephen Hawking warned us about it. Elon Musk
                  has, too. Indeed, Hands found that since modern AI was
                  developed in the 1950s, there have been countless suggestions
                  that the technology will overthrow or supersede humans. Yet

                  “The most fundamental limitation of today’s intelligent
                  machines is that each can achieve only the objective specified
                  by its human programmers,” argues Hands. “To achieve
                  human-level intelligence, it must demonstrate the
                  multifunctionality, flexibility, insights, and
                  self-reflectivity of a human.”

                <p>
                  For now, it is nowhere near. Hands cites the 11 crashes
                  reportedly caused by Tesla’s autopilot software since 2018 –
                  each involved an emergency vehicle using flashing lights,
                  cones, and flares – and facial recognition systems being duped
                  by people wearing sunglasses as examples of how far away the
                  technology currently is.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I suspect that many futurists take insufficient account of
                  the limitations of current AI because of the hyped claims made
                  by companies who profit from selling their AI products,” he
                  writes.

                  Some in the industry disagree. Last July, Google engineer
                  Blake Lemoine lost his job after claiming publicly that its
                  conversational AI system, LaMDA, was sentient.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Holden Karnofsky, CEO of the Open Philanthropy Project,
                  believes that AI doesn’t need super intelligence to inflict
                  chaos. It could, he wrote in a recent blog post, hack into
                  human-built software, or do its own research on how to
                  self-improve, leading to disaster.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the technology also has the potential to solve problems
                  that have hitherto stumped humanity. It looks set to be a
                  valuable tool in the fight against cancer, and already AI is
                  being used to tackle overfishing and deforestation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Which brings us to the climate crisis. It prompted Hands to
                  reduce his own emissions — he gave up his car, stopped flying.
                  He acknowledges that there will be significant disruption if
                  we don’t ramp up climate action. But he argues that notions we
                  could be rendered extinct by a warming world are far from the
                  mark.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “If we take a long-term view, we see that the warm
                  interglacials of the Quaternary period, with their much higher
                  temperatures and greater rise in sea levels than now… was a
                  time when several great human civilisations began and
                  flourished.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, we may already be turning a corner when it comes to
                  reining in emissions. The International Energy Agency said
                  recently that renewables were (slowly) starting to have a
                  measurable impact. Some academics suggest that these kinds of
                  ‘positive tipping points’ could trigger an unstoppable wave of
                  decarbonisation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “This is part of the long-term trend of reflective
                  consciousness,” Hands says. “The more we think about these
                  things, the more action we can take, and the more action we
                  are taking.”
